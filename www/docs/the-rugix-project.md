# The Rugix Project

Rugix (formerly Rugpi) has been started out of frustration with the current state of the embedded Linux ecosystem.
While many excellent tools are already available for building images, updating systems, and managing state, integrating them into a robust, coherent solution remains a significant challenge.
The Rugix Project strives to **simplify the development of embedded Linux devices** by creating a unified suite of development tools that seamlessly integrate to provide a streamlined and efficient workflow for building, updating, and managing embedded Linux systems.
We believe that **building innovative devices shouldn't be as complicated as it often is today**.
By lowering the amount of required engineering resources to build embedded devices, we aim to foster innovation while reducing costs.
