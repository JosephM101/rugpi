# Supported Devices

Rugpi aims to provide out-of-the-box support for a diverse range of devices.

When building a system image with Rugpi, you need to specify a *target* that is appropiate for your device.
Targets typically support a whole family of devices and are categorized into *generic*, *specific*, and *unknown* targets.
Generic targets are based on a standardized booting mechanism and support a wide range of devices.
Specfic targets, on the other hand, are limited to a certain family of devices and unknown targets are for devices that are not specifically supported by Rugpi.
For further details, we refer to the [user guide's section on Image Configuration](../../docs/guide/image-configuration.md).

Device support comes in three different tiers:

- ðŸ¥‡ **Tier 1**: Rugpi is regularly tested on these devices and fully supports them.
- ðŸ¥ˆ **Tier 2**: Support for these devices is provided on a best-effort basis.
- ðŸ¥‰ **Tier 3**: These devices are supported but are rarely tested and not prioritized.
