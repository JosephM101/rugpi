# Supported Devices

:::warning

**This page describes the device support for the upcoming release.**

:::

Rugpi aims to provide out-of-the-box support for a diverse range of devices.

When building a system image with Rugpi, you need to specify a *target* that is appropiate for your device.
Targets typically support a whole family of devices and are categorized into *generic*, *specific*, and *unknown* targets.

- **Generic targets** are based on some standardized booting mechanism, such as [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI) or [EBBR](https://github.com/ARM-software/ebbr).
Generic targets are suitable for any device that supports the respective standardized booting mechanism.
- **Specific targets**, on the other hand, are limited to a certain family of devices.
They come with all necessary device-specific configurations resulting in a bootable image that works out-of-the-box.
- **Unknown targets** are for devices that do not conform to a standardized booting mechanism and are not specifically supported by Rugpi.
Using unknown targets allows building images for unsupported devices; however, these images usually require additional device-specific modifications to become bootable.

Device support comes in three different tiers:

- ðŸ¥‡ **Tier 1**: Rugpi is regularly tested on these devices and fully supports them.
- ðŸ¥ˆ **Tier 2**: Support for these devices is provided on a best-effort basis.
- ðŸ¥‰ **Tier 3**: These devices are supported but are rarely tested and not prioritized.

We are looking to expand device support. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/silitics/rugpi/issues) if you would like to see support for a specific device.
