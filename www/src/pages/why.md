# Why Rugpi?

While many excellent tools are already available for building images, updating systems, and managing state, integrating them into a robust setup can be challenging. Rugpi strives to simplify this process by bundling all essential functionalities into a cohesive package, allowing you to focus on what matters most to you and your users. We believe that building innovative devices shouldn't be as complicated as it often is today. Although Rugpi may *currently* offer less flexibility and configurability than standalone solutions, it excels at delivering a robust base for your device right out of the box.

In case you miss a feature, please feel free to open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/silitics/rugpi/issues/new/choose). Your feedback is invaluable to us, and we continuously strive to improve Rugpi based on the input of our users and their needs.

Additionally, we offer [commercial support](./commercial-support) and are happy to implement specific features as part of our services. If you require bespoke functionalities or need assistance in deploying Rugpi in your projects, please contact us to discuss how we can help.
