üí° **TL;DR**: Rugpi enables you to **build commercial-grade, customized variants of popular Linux distributions** for your devices. It boasts three core features designed to work seamlessly together: (1) A modern, flexible workflow to build customized system images, (2) **robust over-the-air system updates** with rollback support for the entire system, and (3) **managed state** that is preserved across reboots and updates.

- Supports **Debian, Alpine Linux, and Raspberry Pi OS**.
- Supports **all models of Raspberry Pi and any EFI-compatible system**.
- Supports root filesystems built with third-party tools.
