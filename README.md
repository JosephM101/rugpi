üí° **TL;DR**: Rugpi enables you to **build commercial-grade, customized variants of [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)** for your project.
It boasts three core features: (1) A modern workflow to build customized system images, (2) robust **over-the-air updates with rollback support** of the entire system, including firmware files, and (3) **managed state** which is preserved across reboots and updates.
