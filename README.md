  <strong>üöß Rugpi is still experimental. Expect things to change and break! üöß</strong>
</p>

üí° **TL;DR**: Rugpi enables you to **build commercial-grade, customized variants of [Raspberry Pi OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_OS)** for your product.
It boasts two core features: (1) Transactional **over-the-air updates with rollback support** of the entire system, including firmware files, and (2) **managed state** which is preserved across reboots and updates.
