ðŸ’¡ **TL;DR**: Rugpi allows you to build customized Raspberry Pi images based on [Raspberry Pi OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_OS) with two core features: (1) Transactional **over-the-air updates with rollback support** of the entire system including firmware files, and (2) **controlled state** which is preserved across reboots and updates.
